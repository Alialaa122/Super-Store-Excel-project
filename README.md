🧠 Key Insights
Some high-discount transactions result in negative profit.

Top-selling products are not always the most profitable.

Discounts show a weak negative correlation with profit (R² ≈ 0.048), suggesting other factors contribute to loss.

Certain categories (like Technology) drive more profit despite fewer sales.

Regional and customer segment trends highlight where to focus marketing.
